## [Lab 8 - Phong Shading in Sphere](lab8.py)
The Phong shading model is a popular lighting model used in computer graphics to simulate the way surfaces interact with light. It calculates the color of each pixel based on the surface's material properties, the positions of light sources, and the viewer's position.

The code has hardcoded values for material properties and light intensities. The Shine Factor (Î±) can be adjusted using LEFT ARROW and RIGHT ARROW keys. The light source can also be adjusted using a combination of WASD, LSHIFT and LCTRL. The observer is static and assumed to be the user of the program.

To run use `python lab8.py`
